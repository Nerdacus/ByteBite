          I am an aspiring database administrator, just like how I aspire to become the greatest hero! Even though our project wasn't completed as we hoped, I still had an amazing time working alongside my friends. This marks the end of my journey with SELU projects, but it was an experience filled with learning and growth, just like my journey to
          becoming a pro hero!
